    Features:
        -Note Implemented:  all features are implmented

        -Implemented:   all features are implmented

        -Partly implemented: all features are implmented

    Bugs     : executing file _!select does not work only works when i rename the file, and printing blpustree still
    duplicates entires only when printing

    Reflections: rough start at first but once you get table and record down plus the other files
    needed are ones we pretty much have written before and are simple wasnt as bad as i thought, converting a state machine
    to work an sql state machine wasnt to bad. Hardest part was parser and some of the table classes
